# Song-Popularity
Humans have greatly associated themselves with Songs & Music. It can improve mood, decrease pain and anxiety, and facilitate opportunities for emotional expression. Research suggests that music can benefit our physical and mental health in numerous ways.

Lately, multiple studies have been carried out to understand songs & it's popularity based on certain factors. Such song samples are broken down & their parameters are recorded to tabulate. Predicting the Song Popularity is the main aim.
In this project, I trained a prediction model with 20,000 songs' popularity data to predict the probable popularity of future songs and study the main factors affecting this popularity.

There are R and R markdown files that can be opened by RStudio and if you'd like to see the plots and results you're to download the HTML file and open it on your own PC. Hope you find it useful :)
