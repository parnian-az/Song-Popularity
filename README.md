# Song-Popularity
In this project, I trained a prediction model with 20,000 songs' popularity data to predict the probable popularity of future songs and study the main factors affecting this popularity.

There are R and R markdown files that can be opened by RStudio and if you'd like to see the plots and results you're to download the HTML file and open it on your own PC. Hope you find it useful :)
